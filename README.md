# ampere_shunt
Arduino code to measure ampere from input voltage
The following arduino code is to measure current using shunt resistor, TI-01141, Weight, and Power Source for input voltage. The description for each code is already in .ino. For future reference of TI-01141, open the reference file. If you succeed, you should be able to measure current directly from your power source that is shown in arduino board.
